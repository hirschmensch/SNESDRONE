# SNESDRONE
A cartridge für the SNES (Super Famicom) that features an STM32 Microcontroller and an Intel FPGA in order to use the console's built-in DSP as a musical instrument.

It might seem very confusing that I have multiple repositories with the name "SNESDRONE" on my github, but this one will be the definite one. Because right now I am working on an FPGA expansion for the already working µC-only SNESDRONE. This expansion is needed to have a more reliable system, and in order to use the SNESDRONE as a flash cartridge too.

All repositories will be collected into this one.
